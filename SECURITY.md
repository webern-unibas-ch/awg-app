## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues very seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in any webern-unibas-ch-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to info-awg[@]unibas.ch.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

* The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Acknowledgment

We acknowledge every security vulnerability reported to us and strive to address them in a timely manner. We appreciate your patience as we work to resolve the issue.

Contributors who report vulnerabilities will be acknowledged in the project's documentation. However, please note that we do not have a bounty program and cannot provide monetary rewards for vulnerability reports.

Thank you for helping to keep our project secure.
